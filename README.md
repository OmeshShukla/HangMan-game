# PPS Mini Project - HangMan-game

The concept of this hangman game in c code is about guessing letters (A-Z) to form the words. A hangman game is a common word guessing game in which the player must guess one letter at a time to complete a missing word.


One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Originally a Paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions.


# Objective and Working

The objective of this project is to implement the usage of a dictionary to select words at random and enable the user to play the game of HangMan to guess the word.


This hangman game source code in c language ends after a certain number of incorrect guesses, and the player loses. If the player correctly recognizes all of the letters in the missing title, the game is also over. In this project design is straightforward and clean, making it easy for users to learn, use, and navigate.
